# Verification Before Completion

## Description

Mandatory verification process before claiming any task is complete. This skill enforces evidence-based completion rather than assumption-based claims.

## When to Use

- Before claiming tests pass
- Before claiming build succeeds
- Before claiming bug is fixed
- Before marking any task complete
- Before declaring success to user

---

## The 5-Step Verification Process

### Step 1: IDENTIFY

Determine the command that proves your assertion:

```markdown
Claim: "Tests pass"
Verification command: npm test

Claim: "Build succeeds"
Verification command: npm run build

Claim: "Linting passes"
Verification command: npm run lint
```

### Step 2: EXECUTE

Run the command fully and freshly:

```bash
# Don't rely on cached results
# Don't assume previous run is still valid
npm test
```

### Step 3: READ

Read the complete output and exit codes:

```bash
# Check output carefully
# Don't skim - read every line
# Note exit code (0 = success)
```

### Step 4: VERIFY

Confirm the output matches your claim:

```markdown
Claim: "All tests pass"
Output shows: "42 passing, 0 failing"
Verification: âœ“ Claim is accurate
```

### Step 5: CLAIM

Only now make the claim, with evidence:

```markdown
âœ“ All tests pass (42 passing, verified at 2024-01-15 14:30)
```

## Required Validations by Category

### Testing

```bash
# Run test command
npm test

# Verify in output:
# - Zero failures
# - Expected test count
# - No skipped tests (unless intentional)
```

**Not valid**: "Tests should pass" without running them

### Linting

```bash
# Run linter completely
npm run lint

# Verify in output:
# - Zero errors
# - Zero warnings (or acceptable known warnings)
```

**Not valid**: Using lint as proxy for build success

### Building

```bash
# Run build command
npm run build

# Verify:
# - Exit code 0
# - Build artifacts created
# - No errors in output
```

**Not valid**: Assuming lint passing means build passes

### Bug Fixes

```bash
# Step 1: Reproduce original bug
npm test -- --grep "failing test"
# Should fail

# Step 2: Apply fix

# Step 3: Verify fix works
npm test -- --grep "failing test"
# Should pass
```

**Not valid**: Claiming fix works without reproducing original failure

### Regression Tests

Complete red-green cycle required:

```bash
# 1. Write test, run it
npm test  # Should PASS with new test

# 2. Revert the fix
git stash

# 3. Run test again
npm test  # Should FAIL (proves test catches the bug)

# 4. Restore fix
git stash pop

# 5. Run test again
npm test  # Should PASS
```

### Requirements Verification

```markdown
## Original Requirements
1. User can login with email
2. User can reset password
3. Session expires after 24 hours

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Requirement 1: Tested login flow manually + unit tests
- [x] Requirement 2: Tested reset flow manually + integration test
- [x] Requirement 3: Verified SESSION_TIMEOUT=86400 in config + test
```

### Agent Work Verification

Don't trust agent reports blindly:

```bash
# Agent claims: "Fixed the bug in user.ts"

# Verify independently:
git diff src/user.ts  # Check actual changes
npm test              # Verify tests pass
```

---

## Forbidden Language

Never use these phrases without verification:

| Forbidden | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| "should work" | Implies uncertainty |
| "probably fixed" | Not verified |
| "seems to pass" | Didn't read output |
| "I think it's done" | Guessing |
| "Great!" (before checking) | Premature celebration |
| "Done!" (before verification) | Unverified claim |

### Replace With

| Instead Say | After |
|-------------|-------|
| "Tests pass" | Running tests, seeing 0 failures |
| "Build succeeds" | Running build, exit code 0 |
| "Bug is fixed" | Reproducing bug, verifying fix |

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Partial Verification

```markdown
BAD: "I ran one test and it passed"
GOOD: "Full test suite passes (42/42)"
```

### Relying on Prior Runs

```markdown
BAD: "Tests passed earlier"
GOOD: "Tests pass now (just ran)"
```

### Skipping Verification

```markdown
BAD: "This is a small change, no need to verify"
GOOD: "Small change, but verified: tests pass, lint clean"
```

### Trusting Without Checking

```markdown
BAD: Agent said it's fixed, so it's fixed
GOOD: Agent said it's fixed, I verified by running tests
```

## Verification Checklist Template

Use before claiming completion:

```markdown
## Task: [Task Name]

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Tests run: `npm test`
  - Result: [X passing, Y failing]
- [ ] Lint passes: `npm run lint`
  - Result: [No errors]
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
  - Result: [Exit code 0]
- [ ] Requirements met:
  - [ ] Requirement 1: [How verified]
  - [ ] Requirement 2: [How verified]

### Evidence
[Paste relevant output or screenshots]

### Conclusion
âœ“ Task complete, all verifications passed
```
